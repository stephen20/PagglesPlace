  <h1><strong>Background</strong></h1>
  <div class="container well well-sm">
    <p>I started my journey into development work when I chose to study at Marist College. Before transferring to Marist College I was previously a student at Johns Hopkins University (where I was studying computer and electrical engineering). At Marist I studied subjects ranging from object oriented programming, relation databases, functional programming, web development, commonly used algorithms, and of course a core education (history, philosophy...). While pursuing my undergraduate degree I also worked in the archives department of my school as a web developer. During my employment here I built a room reservation system to be used by our librarians. There are more details about this project and others that I have worked on below.</p>

  <p>I created this project from scratch with my boss while working as a web developer in the archives department at Marist College. This web based application is used internally at the school by the librarians to book rooms for students. Prior to the creation of this application the librarians were using a calendar system (similar to Google calandar) to book rooms for students, which got very messy very fast and led to mistakes being made and loads of frustration. Our application aimed to allow librarians to have access to information about each room to make sure students got everything they needed in a room, make it easy to see which rooms were reserved and which were free, make it easy to create and cancel reservations, and allow for staff to keep information on what rooms are being reserved and how each student is treating the rooms when they reserve them.</p>
